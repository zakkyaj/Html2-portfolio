Bio:
Iâ€™m Ajmal, a B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science at C. Abdul Hakeem College of Engineering, affiliated with Anna University. With a solid CGPA of 8.4, Iâ€™m building a strong foundation in AI, machine learning, and full-stack development â€” always focused on creating real-world, scalable solutions.

Beyond lectures and code, Iâ€™m deeply into Esports â€” but not the knock-off mobile games. I play and follow high-end competitive titles like League of Legends, Fortnite, and Valorant, where real strategy and skill separate the pros from the wannabes. The same competitive mindset drives how I learn, build, and collaborate.

Right now, Iâ€™m sharpening my skills in modern web stacks, AI projects, and teamwork â€” ready to take on challenging roles that push me beyond the ordinary. Whether itâ€™s building apps or climbing ranks, I believe in doing it well or not at all.
